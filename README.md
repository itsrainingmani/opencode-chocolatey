This is a [**Chocolatey Community Package**](https://community.chocolatey.org/) repository for packaging & distributing [sst/opencode](https://github.com/sst/opencode) on Windows

## Automatic Package Release

This package runs a github action every [30 minutes](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflows-and-actions/events-that-trigger-workflows#schedule) to check if [sst/opencode](https://github.com/sst/opencode) has a new release. If so, the release is downloaded, packaged, tested & published to Chocolatey.

## Commands

```powershell
# Update package to latest version (fetches checksums automatically)
.\update.ps1

# Check for updates without applying them
.\update.ps1 -CheckOnly

# Build the package
choco pack

# Test installation locally (while downloading dependencies from chocolatey)
choco install opencode -dy --source="'.,https://community.chocolatey.org/api/v2/'"

# Test the installed application
opencode --version

# Test uninstallation
choco uninstall opencode -dvy

# Run test suite
.\test-package.ps1 -Verbose

## Feedback

Please feel free to contribute to this repo! I do not have much experience with writing Chocolatey packages, PowerShell scripting or release management. Almost 100% of this repo was built with auspices of Sonnet 4 in opencode & AmpCode.

You can also leave feedback for this package in the comments section of the [package](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/opencode)
